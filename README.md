#Planes

This challenge set by Makers Academy was to provide an introduction to javascript and jasmine testing.

The objective was to create a program that controls the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. If the weather is bad no planes can land or take off.

To view the tests, run;

$ open SpecRunner.html
